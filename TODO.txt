1) Given single agent, train to find its way to dest, without falling into pit
2) once trained, take it out of this map, put it in new map and see how well it is doing

3) to increase generalization: we can train it on multiple maps
Or
4) to inc generalization: train it with multiple agents on the map. it must avoid collisions

5) to inc generalization even more: have adversarial agents, that chase path-finder agent.

6) Try these expts with DQN, double-DQN, duelling-DQN

7) Compare with baseline cases (DFS etc)
#this is amenable to DQN as each agent takes only 9 possible steps.
